                        In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.
                        “Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m not sure what the advice was, but I’ve always remembered it. The Great Gatsby is a story of the Jazz Age in the United States,
                        a time of prosperity and excess, and it tells the story of Jay Gatsby and his unrequited love for Daisy Buchanan.

                    <p>
                        The novel explores themes of wealth, love, and the American Dream, and it remains one of the most celebrated works of American literature.

                <p>
                    The Great Gatsby follows the story of Jay Gatsby, a wealthy and mysterious man who throws extravagant parties in hopes of reuniting with his lost love, Daisy Buchanan. Set in the Roaring Twenties, the novel explores themes of decadence, idealism, and social change. As Gatsby's obsession with Daisy leads to tragedy, the story critiques the American Dream and the moral decay hidden beneath the glittering surface of wealth and success.
